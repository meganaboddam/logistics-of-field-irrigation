# logistics-of-field-irrigation

Project Summary: 
Identify optimal locations for a minimal number of irrigation taps in an agricultural field

Inputs:
Area of agricultural field in square-meters
Circular area that a single tap can cover in square-meters

Output:
2-D grid with optimal locations for irrigation tap placement marked with x

Future Improvements:
- Handling areas of field that make it difficult to install an irrigation system (rocky soil, hill, old-historic trees, etc) and working around them
- Handling a range of areas that a single tap can cover based on water pressure
